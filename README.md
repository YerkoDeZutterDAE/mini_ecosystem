# mini_ecosystem



In this verry small example of a mini ecosystem. I try to look at the workings of a singular species.
This species focuses on staying alive thru finding food when hungry. And the desire of repopulation based on age.
When the animal's need for repopulation gets activated it will keep an eye open for a mate of the opposite sex. That also has a desire to repopulate. they will create a new animal that will have to find food to survive.

These animals have momentarily 2 way's of passing away. When it’s hunger becomes to much to handle the animal will die of hunger.
However if it manages to eat. It still is possible of simply passing away dew to old age. Bye the ripe old age of 100. Whit a need for maximum of 10 children in total.

## data extraction

I wished to give them a predator before testing population growth. But dew to time problems I had to already test population growth whit just these animal’s. But that seemed to already give more info then I first expected.

At first I gave the animals to much sex drive and to much food. Dew to this the population kept gowring without stop. I did not even manage to see the ground after a few seconds.
When forcefully giving them less sex drive and making the need for food higher. This gave the growth of the population immediately stagnation.
Even whit little thinking. Only going to the food it has taken notice before. When hungry. It automatically made small Connally’s based on the location of there chosen food source. 
Some of these Connally’s even died out for just not having enuf of the opposite sex.

## Conclution
What is implemented is not much. And what I wanned to implement was more. But whit this we can already see that whit the smallest natural behavior. You can already make an open place feal lived in. Especially if you change the texture of the ground depending on how much animals have been running around these part’s.

Whit slowing down time. Someone can also make it look like a place does not just feel lived in. but make it easily feel like the animals in this habitat actually live in it wright now
